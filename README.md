# ðŸ“š Reading Statistics Visualizer

A personal dashboard that helps me track and visualize my reading habits using data from my own CSV file. Built with Next.js and Chart.js, it shows me some insights about my reading journey including:

- Books read by genre
- Fiction vs non-fiction split
- Reading pace trends
- Monthly reading stats
- Top authors

Ultimately, I did not want the vendor lock-in of using services like Goodreads (owned by Amazon). There were other smaller competitors that were pretty cool, like Storygraph, but I just wanted a little bit of extra control over the user experience, more than trying to protect my data (it looks like they have a nice way to export your data).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
